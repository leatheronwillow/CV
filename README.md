## Mohammad Hassan Azad
I am a driven and compassionate software developer thoroughly enjoying the process of test-driven development in Agile teams at Makers Academy. Apart from strong coding fundamentals in object oriented programming, my main strength is an ability to empathise developed from my interactions with people from diverse backgrounds playing cricket around the world as a professional cricketer and coach. This empathy, coupled with a growth mindset and a sense of responsibility, makes me an excellent teammate and drives me to help clients pursue their passion through technology.

## Skills

#### Communication
As a coach, I have had to develop excellent presentation skills to communicate effectively with large groups. I have had to make a good initial impression to gain respect, particularly when coaching young children.

#### Time Management
I have had to balance cricket commitments and academia for most of my life. This was a particular challenge in my final year at university when I had to complete my individual and group design projects whilst working full time as a professional cricketer; a weekly commitment of 50 hours. I managed my time by writing reports whilst waiting for my turn to bat, on the team bus and during meals. I left fluid mechanics simulations to run in the computer labs before leaving for games so that the results were ready for analysis on my return. I did not let my team down as my section of the report was completed on time and our group achieved a first-class grade. 

#### Analysis
My role as a legal intern required scrutinising legal documents to identify possible weaknesses or loopholes. I developed an appreciation for following logical trains of thought when researching landmark judgements in past cases.  My role as a coach required me to scrutinize the environment for safety risks and take steps to mitigate them. Furthermore, I had to dissect batting technique and provide bespoke, creative solutions to technical deficiencies. As a player, I have to make minute adjustments on the basis of playing conditions and the strengths of the opposition. Off the field, video analysis has been an important tool for self-improvement.
